There are many kinds of superhard materials in nature. Interesting phenomena occur when superhard materials are subjected to external stress. We have studied three superhard materials: diamond, cubic boron nitride and Lonsdaleite, and explored their behavior when subjected to stress in different directions through computational physics methods.

As is known to all, pixel is the smallest unit of CMOS/CCD imaging traditionally. However, using sub-pixel fitting is an efficient way to break this limit. Based on this, a high-precision testing system whose minimum resolution is 0.1Âµm has been established. Figure 2 shows the procedures of using the sub-pixel fitting based analysis software (time-axis).
