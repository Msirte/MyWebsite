For a long time, I have been thinking about a question, and that is what **information** is. Although the word information is often used in daily life, there does not seem to be an exact and reasonable definition of information. How information is generated, how it disappears, how it is measured, and how it is manipulated, all of these have not been well studied.  

Shannon's information theory gave a definition and measurement of information which achieved great success. However, if you study in depth, you will find that the main use of Shannon's information theory is in the field of communication and data compression. Moreover, an important question is, is the information **physics**? Here we discuss the physics of information, which means whether information can be bring into the modern physics system. In the field of physics, a property is a physics, which means that it can be associated with a certain entity or process and should be **measurable**. Measurement is an ancient physics concept. In a narrow sense, physics only deals with quantities that can be measured. But the practical difficulty is that we cannot measure the amount of information contained in a certain entity or process by a certain instrument, and it is still unknown whether the information itself does belong to a certain entity or process. This has caused great difficulties for informatics research, because if we cannot measure information, it means that we do not know the way in which information interacts with other physics quantities, and naturally cannot manipulate the information. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is that the word information has many ambiguities. When we talk about information, we are not very clear about what we are talking about. If we talk about the mass of a table, this is easy to understand. However, if we talk about the information of a table, it can be very confusing. Some people believe that because of this ambiguity, information cannot become a physics quantity. But I don't think so, because there are many vague concepts in history, and some of them have indeed become physics quantities with clear meaning and can be measured. Energy is an example. In ancient times, when we talked about energy, this concept was vague. Although we can vaguely feel the difference in the amount of energy possessed by different entities, it is still difficult for us to accurately describe how energy is measured. I think information also requires a clearly definition, and this will eventually open a window to informatics.
